Final Assignment of Web Dev II 

## About the Project
This is a responsive website for **PlantPalette**, a plant-based restaurant. The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and an additional CSS library. It is fully accessible and mobile-friendly.


---

### My Workflow
- Implemented responsive behavior with media queries.
- Planned page layout and components based on restaurant needs.
- Used semantic HTML5 tags for accessibility.
- Designed and styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- Ensured keyboard navigation and proper ARIA roles.

### Challenges I Faced
- Getting grid layouts to behave properly across breakpoints.
- Making text and images fully responsive without breaking the layout.
- Making navigation and footer content accessible with keyboard alone.

### How I Overcame Them
- Used browser developer tools to test responsiveness and fix layout bugs.
- Referred to Bootstrap documentation and accessibility guidelines.
- Tested on different screen sizes and used keyboard tabbing to evaluate accessibility.

##  What I Learned
- Improved my understanding of **responsive design** using Bootstrap Grid and media queries.
- Learned how to use the `<picture>` tag and `srcset` for responsive images.
- Gained experience with accessibility techniques like ARIA roles and semantic markup.
